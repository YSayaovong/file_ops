# File Operations Lab

This Python script performs various file operations, including reading, writing, and manipulating file data. It reads contents from a given file, processes the data, and outputs results to a new file or in different formats.

## Lab Objectives

The main objectives of this lab are:
1. Create a function to read the contents of a file.
2. Create functions to manipulate file contents (e.g., reading specific lines).
3. Write contents to a file, including handling specific cases (e.g., writing the first line).
4. Retain newline characters where required for correct output formatting.

## Tips: Before You Begin

- To work efficiently in Visual Studio Code (VSCode):
  - Use `View -> Editor Layout -> Two Columns` to view instructions and code side-by-side.
  - Run Python files using the "Run Python File in Terminal" option or use the play button in the top-right corner of VSCode.

## Instructions

1. **Ensure the following files are present inside the project folder**:
   - `sampletext.txt` (sample input file)
   - `file_ops.py` (Python script)

2. **Run the script** by executing the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash
   python3 file_ops.py
